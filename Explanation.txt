Attached is the sequence of steps for the bike from step to step


Each row has state values in the following order:

'X', 'Y', 'Omega', 'Omegadt', 'Theta', 'Thetadt', 'Psi', 'Action'

Position, Position, angle of handle bars, angle of handle bars, angle of bike to horizontal, angle of bike to horizontal, ?,?

Read each row using numpy and use values to guide bike

Do they represent position x, position y, angle to destination, angle
of bike, angle of bike handle, angular velocity of bike, angular
velocity of bike handle?
